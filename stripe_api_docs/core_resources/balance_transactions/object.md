# The Balance Transaction object

- `id` (string)
  Unique identifier for the object.

- `object` (string)
  String representing the object’s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

- `amount` (integer)
  Gross amount of this transaction (in ). A positive value represents funds charged to another party, and a negative value represents funds sent to another party.

- `available_on` (timestamp)
  The date that the transaction’s net funds become available in the Stripe balance.

- `created` (timestamp)
  Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

- `currency` (enum)
  Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

- `description` (nullable string)
  An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.

- `exchange_rate` (nullable float)
  If applicable, this transaction uses an exchange rate. If money converts from currency A to currency B, then the `amount` in currency A, multipled by the `exchange_rate`, equals the `amount` in currency B. For example, if you charge a customer 10.00 EUR, the PaymentIntent’s `amount` is `1000` and `currency` is `eur`. If this converts to 12.34 USD in your Stripe account, the BalanceTransaction’s `amount` is `1234`, its `currency` is `usd`, and the `exchange_rate` is `1.234`.

- `fee` (integer)
  Fees (in ) paid for this transaction. Represented as a positive integer when assessed.

- `fee_details` (array of objects)
  Detailed breakdown of fees (in ) paid for this transaction.

  - `fee_details.type` (string)
    Type of the fee, one of: `application_fee`, `payment_method_passthrough_fee`, `stripe_fee` or `tax`.

- `net` (integer)
  Net impact to a Stripe balance (in ). A positive value represents incrementing a Stripe balance, and a negative value decrementing a Stripe balance. You can calculate the net impact of a transaction on a balance by `amount` - `fee`

- `reporting_category` (string)
