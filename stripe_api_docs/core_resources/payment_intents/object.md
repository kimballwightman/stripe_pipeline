# The PaymentIntent object

- `id` (string)
  Unique identifier for the object.

- `object` (string)
  String representing the object’s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

- `amount` (integer)
  Amount intended to be collected by this PaymentIntent. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies.md#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies.md#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).

- `amount_capturable` (integer)
  Amount that can be captured from this PaymentIntent.

- `amount_details` (nullable object)
  Provides industry-specific information about the amount.

  - `amount_details.tip` (nullable object)
    Portion of the amount that corresponds to a tip.

    - `amount_details.tip.amount` (nullable integer)
      Portion of the amount that corresponds to a tip.

- `amount_received` (integer)
  Amount that this PaymentIntent collects.

- `application` (nullable string)
  ID of the Connect application that created the PaymentIntent.

- `application_fee_amount` (nullable integer)
  The amount of the application fee (if any) that will be requested to be applied to the payment and transferred to the application owner’s Stripe account. The amount of the application fee collected will be capped at the total amount captured. For more information, see the PaymentIntents [use case for connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/connected-accounts.md).

- `automatic_payment_methods` (nullable object)
  Settings to configure compatible payment methods from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)

  - `automatic_payment_methods.allow_redirects` (nullable enum)
    Controls whether this PaymentIntent will accept redirect-based payment methods.

    Redirect-based payment methods may require your customer to be redirected to a payment method’s app or site for authentication or additional steps. To [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) this PaymentIntent, you may be required to provide a `return_url` to redirect customers back to your site after they authenticate or complete the payment.

    (Default) This PaymentIntent will accept redirect-based payment methods. `return_url` may be required to       [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) this PaymentIntent.

    This PaymentIntent will not accept redirect-based payment methods. Payment methods that require redirect will       be filtered. `return_url` will not be required to [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm.md) this       PaymentIntent.

  - `automatic_payment_methods.enabled` (boolean)
    Automatically calculates compatible payment methods

- `canceled_at` (nullable timestamp)
  Populated when `status` is `canceled`, this is the time at which the PaymentIntent was canceled. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

- `cancellation_reason` (nullable enum)
  Reason for cancellation of this PaymentIntent, either user-provided (`duplicate`, `fraudulent`, `requested_by_customer`, or `abandoned`) or generated by Stripe internally (`failed_invoice`, `void_invoice`, `automatic`, or `expired`).

- `capture_method` (enum)
  Controls when the funds will be captured from the customer’s account.

  Stripe automatically captures funds when the customer authorizes the payment.

  (Default) Stripe asynchronously captures funds when the customer authorizes the payment. Recommended over `capture_method=automatic` due to improved latency. Read the [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents/asynchronous-capture.md) for more information.

  Place a hold on the funds when the customer authorizes the payment, but [don’t capture the funds until later](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/capture-later.md). (Not all payment methods support this.)

- `client_secret` (nullable string)
  The client secret of this PaymentIntent. Used for client-side retrieval using a publishable key.

  The client secret can be used to complete a payment from your frontend. It should not be stored, logged, or exposed to anyone other than the customer. Make sure that you have TLS enabled on any page that includes the client secret.

  Refer to our docs to [accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment.md?ui=elements) and learn about how `client_secret` should be handled.

- `confirmation_method` (enum)
  Describes whether we can confirm this PaymentIntent automatically, or if it requires customer action to confirm the payment.

  (Default) PaymentIntent can be confirmed using a publishable key. After `next_action`s are handled, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment.

  All payment attempts must be made using a secret key. The PaymentIntent returns to the `requires_confirmation` state after handling `next_action`s, and requires your server to initiate each payment attempt with an explicit confirmation.

- `created` (timestamp)
  Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

- `currency` (enum)
  Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

- `customer` (nullable string)
  ID of the Customer this PaymentIntent belongs to, if one exists.

  Payment methods attached to other Customers cannot be used with this PaymentIntent.

  If [setup_future_usage](#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) is set and this PaymentIntent’s payment method is not `card_present`, then the payment method attaches to the Customer after the PaymentIntent has been confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If the payment method is `card_present` and isn’t a digital wallet, then a [generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card) payment method representing the card is created and attached to the Customer instead.

- `description` (nullable string)
  An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
