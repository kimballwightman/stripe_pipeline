# List all events

List events, going back up to 30 days. Each event data is rendered according to Stripe API version at its creation time, specified in [event object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object) `api_version` attribute (not according to your current Stripe API version or `Stripe-Version` header).

A dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array of up to `limit` events, starting after event `starting_after`. Each entry in the array is a separate event object. If no more events are available, the resulting array will be empty.

- `created` (object, optional)
  Only return events that were created during the given date interval.

  - `created.gt` (integer, optional)
    Minimum value to filter by (exclusive)

  - `created.gte` (integer, optional)
    Minimum value to filter by (inclusive)

  - `created.lt` (integer, optional)
    Maximum value to filter by (exclusive)

  - `created.lte` (integer, optional)
    Maximum value to filter by (inclusive)

- `delivery_success` (boolean, optional)
  Filter events by whether all webhooks were successfully delivered. If false, events which are still pending or have failed all delivery attempts to a webhook endpoint will be returned.

- `ending_before` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

- `limit` (integer, optional)
  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `type` (string, optional)
  A string containing a specific event name, or group of events using * as a wildcard. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property.

- `types` (array of strings, optional)
  An array of up to 20 strings containing specific event names. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property. You may pass either `type` or `types`, but not both.

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new EventListOptions { Limit = 3 };
var service = new EventService();
StripeList<Event> events = service.List(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.EventListParams{};
params.Limit = stripe.Int64(3)
result := event.List(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

EventListParams params = EventListParams.builder().setLimit(3L).build();

EventCollection events = Event.list(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const events = await stripe.events.list({
  limit: 3,
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

events = stripe.Event.list(limit=3)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$events = $stripe->events->all(['limit' => 3]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

events = Stripe::Event.list({limit: 3})
```
