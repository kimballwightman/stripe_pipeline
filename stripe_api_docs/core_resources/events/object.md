# The Event object

- `id` (string)
  Unique identifier for the object.

- `object` (string)
  String representing the object’s type. Objects of the same type share the same value.

- `account` (nullable string)
  The connected account that originates the event.

- `api_version` (nullable string)
  The Stripe API version used to render `data` when the event was created. The contents of `data` never change, so this value remains static regardless of the API version currently in use. This property is populated only for events created on or after October 31, 2014.

- `created` (timestamp)
  Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

- `data` (object)
  Object containing data associated with the event.

  - `data.object` (object)
    Object containing the API resource relevant to the event. For example, an `invoice.created` event will have a full [invoice object](#invoice_object) as the value of the object key.

  - `data.previous_attributes` (nullable object)
    Object containing the names of the updated attributes and their values prior to the event (only included in events of type `*.updated`). If an array attribute has any updated elements, this object contains the entire array. In Stripe API versions 2017-04-06 or earlier, an updated array attribute in this object includes only the updated array elements.

- `livemode` (boolean)
  Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.

- `pending_webhooks` (integer)
  Number of webhooks that haven’t been successfully delivered (for example, to return a 20x response) to the URLs you specify.

- `request` (nullable object)
  Information on the API request that triggers the event.

  - `request.id` (nullable string)
    ID of the API request that caused the event. If null, the event was automatic (e.g., Stripe’s automatic subscription handling). Request logs are available in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs), but currently not in the API.

  - `request.idempotency_key` (nullable string)
    The idempotency key transmitted during the request, if any. *Note: This property is populated only for events on or after May 23, 2017*.

- `type` (string)
  Description of the event (for example, `invoice.created` or `charge.refunded`).
