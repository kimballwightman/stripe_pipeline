# Capture a charge

Capture the payment of an existing, uncaptured charge that was created with the `capture` option set to false.

Uncaptured payments expire a set number of days after they are created ([7 by default](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/charges/placing-a-hold.md)), after which they are marked as refunded and capture attempts will fail.

Don’t use this method to capture a PaymentIntent-initiated charge. Use [Capture a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/capture.md).

Returns the charge object, with an updated captured property (set to true). Capturing a charge will always succeed, unless the charge is already refunded, expired, captured, or an invalid capture amount is specified, in which case this method will raise [an error](#errors).

- `amount` (integer, optional)
  The amount to capture, which must be less than or equal to the original amount.

- `application_fee_amount` (integer, optional)
  An application fee amount to add on to this charge, which must be less than or equal to the original amount.

- `receipt_email` (string, optional)
  The email address to send this charge’s receipt to. This will override the previously-specified email address for this charge, if one was set. Receipts will not be sent in test mode.

- `statement_descriptor` (string, optional)
  For a non-card charge, text that appears on the customer’s statement as the statement descriptor. This value overrides the account’s default statement descriptor. For information about requirements, including the 22-character limit, see [the Statement Descriptor docs](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).

  For a card charge, this value is ignored unless you don’t specify a `statement_descriptor_suffix`, in which case this value is used as the suffix.

- `statement_descriptor_suffix` (string, optional)
  Provides information about a card charge. Concatenated to the account’s [statement descriptor prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#static) to form the complete statement descriptor that appears on the customer’s statement. If the account has no prefix value, the suffix is concatenated to the account’s statement descriptor.

- `transfer_data` (object, optional)
  An optional dictionary including the account to automatically transfer to as part of a destination charge. [See the Connect documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges.md) for details.

  - `transfer_data.amount` (integer, optional)
    The amount transferred to the destination account, if specified. By default, the entire charge amount is transferred to the destination account.

- `transfer_group` (string, optional)
  A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. `transfer_group` may only be provided if it has not been set. See the [Connect documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md#transfer-options) for details.
