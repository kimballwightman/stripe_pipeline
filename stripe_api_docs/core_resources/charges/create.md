# Create a charge

This method is no longer recommended—use the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents.md)
to initiate a new payment instead. Confirmation of the PaymentIntent creates the `Charge`
object used to request payment.

Returns the charge object if the charge succeeded.
This call raises [an error](#errors) if something goes wrong.
A common source of error is an invalid or expired card,
or a valid card with insufficient available balance.

- `amount` (integer, required)
  Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies.md#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/currencies.md#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).

- `currency` (enum, required)
  Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

- `application_fee_amount` (integer, optional)
  A fee in  that will be applied to the charge and transferred to the application owner’s Stripe account. The request must be made with an OAuth key or the `Stripe-Account` header in order to take an application fee. For more information, see the application fees [documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/direct-charges.md#collect-fees).

- `capture` (boolean, optional)
  Whether to immediately capture the charge. Defaults to `true`. When `false`, the charge issues an authorization (or pre-authorization), and will need to be [captured](#capture_charge) later. Uncaptured charges expire after a set number of days (7 by default). For more information, see the [authorizing charges and settling later](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/charges/placing-a-hold.md) documentation.

- `customer` (string, optional)
  The ID of an existing customer that will be charged in this request.

- `description` (string, optional)
  An arbitrary string which you can attach to a `Charge` object. It is displayed when in the web interface alongside the charge. Note that if you use Stripe to send automatic email receipts to your customers, your receipt emails will include the `description` of the charge(s) that they are describing.

- `metadata` (object, optional)
  Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/metadata.md) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.

- `on_behalf_of` (string, optional)
  The Stripe account ID for which these funds are intended. Automatically set if you use the `destination` parameter. For details, see [Creating Separate Charges and Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md#settlement-merchant).

- `radar_options` (object, optional)
  Options to configure Radar. See [Radar Session](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/radar/radar-session.md) for more information.

  - `radar_options.session` (string, optional)
    A [Radar Session](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/radar/radar-session.md) is a snapshot of the browser metadata and device details that help Radar make more accurate predictions on your payments.

- `receipt_email` (string, optional)
  The email address to which this charge’s [receipt](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/dashboard/receipts.md) will be sent. The receipt will not be sent until the charge is paid, and no receipts will be sent for test mode charges. If this charge is for a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object.md), the email address specified here will override the customer’s email address. If `receipt_email` is specified for a charge in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).

- `shipping` (object, optional)
  Shipping information for the charge. Helps prevent fraud on charges for physical goods.

  - `shipping.address` (object, required)
    Shipping address.

    - `shipping.address.city` (string, optional)
      City, district, suburb, town, or village.

    - `shipping.address.country` (string, optional)
      Two-letter country code ([ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)).

    - `shipping.address.line1` (string, optional)
      Address line 1 (e.g., street, PO Box, or company name).

    - `shipping.address.line2` (string, optional)
      Address line 2 (e.g., apartment, suite, unit, or building).

    - `shipping.address.postal_code` (string, optional)
      ZIP or postal code.

    - `shipping.address.state` (string, optional)
      State, county, province, or region.

  - `shipping.name` (string, required)
    Recipient name.

  - `shipping.carrier` (string, optional)
    The delivery service that shipped a physical product, such as Fedex, UPS, USPS, etc.

  - `shipping.phone` (string, optional)
    Recipient phone (including extension).

  - `shipping.tracking_number` (string, optional)
    The tracking number for a physical product, obtained from the delivery service. If multiple tracking numbers were generated for this purchase, please separate them with commas.

- `source` (string, optional)
  A payment source to be charged. This can be the ID of a [card](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#cards) (i.e., credit or debit card), a [bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#bank_accounts), a [source](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#sources), a [token](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#tokens), or a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/account-debits.md#charging-a-connected-account). For certain sources—namely, [cards](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#cards), [bank accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#bank_accounts), and attached [sources](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#sources)—you must also pass the ID of the associated customer.

- `statement_descriptor` (string, optional)
  For a non-card charge, text that appears on the customer’s statement as the statement descriptor. This value overrides the account’s default statement descriptor. For information about requirements, including the 22-character limit, see [the Statement Descriptor docs](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).

  For a card charge, this value is ignored unless you don’t specify a `statement_descriptor_suffix`, in which case this value is used as the suffix.

- `statement_descriptor_suffix` (string, optional)
  Provides information about a card charge. Concatenated to the account’s [statement descriptor prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#static) to form the complete statement descriptor that appears on the customer’s statement. If the account has no prefix value, the suffix is concatenated to the account’s statement descriptor.

- `transfer_data` (object, optional)
  An optional dictionary including the account to automatically transfer to as part of a destination charge. [See the Connect documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges.md) for details.

  - `transfer_data.destination` (string, required)
    ID of an existing, connected Stripe account.

  - `transfer_data.amount` (integer, optional)
    The amount transferred to the destination account, if specified. By default, the entire charge amount is transferred to the destination account.

- `transfer_group` (string, optional)
  A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. For details, see [Grouping transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md#transfer-options).
