# List all payments for an invoice

When retrieving an invoice, there is an includable payments property containing the first handful of those items. There is also a URL where you can retrieve the full (paginated) list of payments.

A dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array of up to `limit` invoice payments, starting after invoice payment `starting_after`. Each entry in the array is a separate [invoice_payment object](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/payments.md). If no more invoice payments are available, the resulting array will be empty.

- `ending_before` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

- `invoice` (string, optional)
  The identifier of the invoice whose payments to return.

- `limit` (integer, optional)
  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

- `payment` (object, optional)
  The payment details of the invoice payments to return.

  - `payment.type` (enum, required)
    Only return invoice payments associated by this payment type.

    Indicates that a `PaymentIntent` object is being associated with this invoice payment.

  - `payment.payment_intent` (string, optional)
    Only return invoice payments associated by this payment intent ID.

- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `status` (enum, optional)
  The status of the invoice payments to return.

  The payment has been canceled; it will not be credited to the invoice.

  The payment is incomplete and isnâ€™t credited to the invoice. More fine-grained information available on the payment intent

  The payment is complete and has been credited to the invoice.
