# Retrieve a credit note's line items

When retrieving a credit note, youâ€™ll get a **lines** property containing the first handful of those items. There is also a URL where you can retrieve the full (paginated) list of line items.

Returns a list of [line_item objects](#credit_note_line_item_object).

- `ending_before` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

- `limit` (integer, optional)
  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
