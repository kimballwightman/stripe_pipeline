# Create a plan

You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.

Returns the plan object.

- `currency` (enum, required)
  Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

- `interval` (enum, required)
  Specifies billing frequency. Either `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`.

- `product` (object, required)
  The product whose pricing the created plan will represent. This can either be the ID of an existing product, or a dictionary containing fields used to create a [service product](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#product_object-type).

  - `product.name` (string, required)
    The product’s name, meant to be displayable to the customer.

  - `product.active` (boolean, optional)
    Whether the product is currently available for purchase. Defaults to `true`.

  - `product.metadata` (object, optional)
    Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/metadata.md) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.

  - `product.statement_descriptor` (string, optional)
    An arbitrary string to be displayed on your customer’s credit card or bank statement. While most banks display this information consistently, some may display it incorrectly or not at all.

    This may be up to 22 characters. The statement description may not include `<`, `>`, `\`, `"`, `'` characters, and will appear on your customer’s statement in capital letters. Non-ASCII characters are automatically stripped.

  - `product.tax_code` (string, optional)
    A [tax code](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/tax/tax-categories.md) ID.

  - `product.unit_label` (string, optional)
    A label that represents units of this product. When set, this will be included in customers’ receipts, invoices, Checkout, and the customer portal.

- `active` (boolean, optional)
  Whether the plan is currently available for new subscriptions. Defaults to `true`.

- `amount` (integer, optional)
  A positive integer in  (or 0 for a free plan) representing how much to charge on a recurring basis.

- `amount_decimal` (string, optional)
  Same as `amount`, but accepts a decimal value with at most 12 decimal places. Only one of `amount` and `amount_decimal` can be set.

- `billing_scheme` (enum, optional)
  Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit` or `tiered`. `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in `amount`) will be charged per unit in `quantity` (for plans with `usage_type=licensed`), or per unit of total usage (for plans with `usage_type=metered`). `tiered` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as defined using the `tiers` and `tiers_mode` attributes.

- `id` (string, optional)
  An identifier randomly generated by Stripe. Used to identify this plan when subscribing a customer. You can optionally override this ID, but the ID must be unique across all plans in your Stripe account. You can, however, use the same plan ID in both live and test modes.

- `interval_count` (integer, optional)
  The number of intervals between subscription billings. For example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months. Maximum of three years interval allowed (3 years, 36 months, or 156 weeks).

- `metadata` (object, optional)
  Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/metadata.md) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.

- `meter` (string, optional)
  The meter tracking the usage of a metered price

- `nickname` (string, optional)
  A brief description of the plan, hidden from customers.

- `tiers` (array of objects, optional)
  Each element represents a pricing tier. This parameter requires `billing_scheme` to be set to `tiered`. See also the documentation for `billing_scheme`.

  - `tiers.up_to` (string | integer, required)
    Specifies the upper bound of this tier. The lower bound of a tier is the upper bound of the previous tier adding one. Use `inf` to define a fallback tier.

  - `tiers.flat_amount` (integer, optional)
    The flat billing amount for an entire tier, regardless of the number of units in the tier.

  - `tiers.flat_amount_decimal` (string, optional)
    Same as `flat_amount`, but accepts a decimal value representing an integer in the minor units of the currency. Only one of `flat_amount` and `flat_amount_decimal` can be set.

  - `tiers.unit_amount` (integer, optional)
    The per unit billing amount for each individual unit for which this tier applies.

  - `tiers.unit_amount_decimal` (string, optional)
    Same as `unit_amount`, but accepts a decimal value in  with at most 12 decimal places. Only one of `unit_amount` and `unit_amount_decimal` can be set.

- `tiers_mode` (enum, optional)
  Defines if the tiering price should be `graduated` or `volume` based. In `volume`-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per unit price, in `graduated` tiering pricing can successively change as the quantity grows.

- `transform_usage` (object, optional)
  Apply a transformation to the reported usage or set quantity before computing the billed price. Cannot be combined with `tiers`.

  - `transform_usage.divide_by` (integer, required)
    Divide usage by this number.

  - `transform_usage.round` (enum, required)
    After division, either round the result `up` or `down`.

- `trial_period_days` (integer, optional)
  Default number of trial days when subscribing a customer to this plan using [`trial_from_plan=true`](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#create_subscription-trial_from_plan).

- `usage_type` (enum, optional)
  Configures how the quantity per period should be determined. Can be either `metered` or `licensed`. `licensed` automatically bills the `quantity` set when adding it to a subscription. `metered` aggregates the total usage based on usage records. Defaults to `licensed`.
