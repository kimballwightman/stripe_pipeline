# Create a subscription

Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.

When you create a subscription with `collection_method=charge_automatically`, the first invoice is finalized as part of the request.
The `payment_behavior` parameter determines the exact behavior of the initial payment.

To start subscriptions where the first invoice always begins in a `draft` status, use [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules.md#managing) instead.
Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing configurations that change over time.

The newly created `Subscription` object, if the call succeeded. If the attempted charge fails, the subscription is created in an `incomplete` status.

When updating, pass an empty string to remove previously-defined tax rates.

- `metadata` (object, optional)
  Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/metadata.md) that you can attach to an object.

  The account on behalf of which to charge, for each of the subscription’s invoices.

- `payment_behavior` (enum, optional)
  Only applies to subscriptions with `collection_method=charge_automatically`.

  Use `allow_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice can’t be paid. Creating Subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication.md) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

  Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication.md), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

  Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription’s first invoice can’t be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer action is needed, this parameter doesn’t create a Subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/upgrades.md#2019-03-14) to learn more.

  `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a Subscription.

        We strongly recommend that you rely on our SCA Engine to automatically prompt your customers for authentication based on risk level and [other requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication.md). However, if you wish to request 3D Secure based on logic from your own fraud engine, provide this option. Read our guide on [manually requesting 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#manual-three-ds) for more information on how this configuration interacts with Radar and our SCA Engine.

        Use `any` to manually request 3DS with a preference for a `frictionless` flow, increasing the likelihood of the authentication being completed without any additional input from the customer.
        3DS will always be attempted if it is supported for the card, but Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow.
        To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

        (Default) Our SCA Engine automatically prompts your customers for authentication based on risk level and other requirements.

        Use `challenge` to request 3DS with a preference for a `challenge` flow, where the customer must respond to a prompt for active authentication. Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

  - `payment_settings.save_default_payment_method` (enum, optional)
    Configure whether Stripe updates `subscription.default_payment_method` when payment succeeds. Defaults to `off` if unspecified.

    Stripe never sets `subscription.default_payment_method`.

    Stripe sets `subscription.default_payment_method` when a subscription payment succeeds.

- `pending_invoice_item_interval` (object, optional)
  Specifies an interval for how often to bill for any pending invoice items. It is analogous to calling [Create an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api.md#create_invoice) for the given subscription at the specified interval.

  - `pending_invoice_item_interval.interval` (enum, required)
    Specifies invoicing frequency. Either `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`.

  - `pending_invoice_item_interval.interval_count` (integer, optional)
    The number of intervals between invoices. For example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months. Maximum of one year interval allowed (1 year, 12 months, or 52 weeks).

- `proration_behavior` (enum, optional)
  Determines how to handle [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md) resulting from the `billing_cycle_anchor`. If no value is passed, the default is `create_prorations`.

  **Unsupported** for subscription creation.

  Will cause proration invoice items to be created when applicable.

  Disable creating prorations in this request.

- `transfer_data` (object, optional)
  If specified, the funds from the subscription’s invoices will be transferred to the destination and the ID of the resulting transfers will be found on the resulting charges.

  - `transfer_data.destination` (string, required)
    ID of an existing, connected Stripe account.

  - `transfer_data.amount_percent` (float, optional)
    A non-negative decimal between 0 and 100, with at most two decimal places. This represents the percentage of the subscription invoice total that will be transferred to the destination account. By default, the entire amount is transferred to the destination.

- `trial_end` (string | timestamp, optional)
  Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time. If set, trial_end will override the default trial period of the plan the customer is being subscribed to. The special value `now` can be provided to end the customer’s trial immediately. Can be at most two years from `billing_cycle_anchor`. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md) to learn more.

- `trial_from_plan` (boolean, optional)
  Indicates if a plan’s `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `trial_end` is not allowed. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md) to learn more.

- `trial_period_days` (integer, optional)
  Integer representing the number of trial period days before the customer is charged for the first time. This will always overwrite any trials that might apply via a subscribed plan. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md) to learn more.

- `trial_settings` (object, optional)
  Settings related to subscription trials.

  - `trial_settings.end_behavior` (object, required)
    Defines how the subscription should behave when the user’s free trial ends.

    - `trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method` (enum, required)
      Indicates how the subscription should change when the trial ends if the user did not provide a payment method.

      Cancel the subscription if a payment method is not attached when the trial ends.

      Create an invoice when the trial ends, even if the user did not set up a payment method.

      Pause the subscription if a payment method is not attached when the trial ends.
