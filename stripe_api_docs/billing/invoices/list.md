# List all invoices

You can list all invoices, or list the invoices for a specific customer. The invoices are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created invoices appearing first.

A dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array invoice attachments,

- `collection_method` (enum, optional)
  The collection method of the invoice to retrieve. Either `charge_automatically` or `send_invoice`.

- `created` (object, optional)
  Only return invoices that were created during the given date interval.

  - `created.gt` (integer, optional)
    Minimum value to filter by (exclusive)

  - `created.gte` (integer, optional)
    Minimum value to filter by (inclusive)

  - `created.lt` (integer, optional)
    Maximum value to filter by (exclusive)

  - `created.lte` (integer, optional)
    Maximum value to filter by (inclusive)

- `customer` (string, optional)
  Only return invoices for the customer specified by this customer ID.

- `ending_before` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

- `limit` (integer, optional)
  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

- `starting_after` (string, optional)
  A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `status` (enum, optional)
  The status of the invoice, one of `draft`, `open`, `paid`, `uncollectible`, or `void`. [Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow.md#workflow-overview)

- `subscription` (string, optional)
  Only return invoices for the subscription specified by this subscription ID.

```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var options = new InvoiceListOptions { Limit = 3 };
var service = new InvoiceService();
StripeList<Invoice> invoices = service.List(options);
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.InvoiceListParams{};
params.Limit = stripe.Int64(3)
result := invoice.List(params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

InvoiceListParams params = InvoiceListParams.builder().setLimit(3L).build();

InvoiceCollection invoices = Invoice.list(params);
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const invoices = await stripe.invoices.list({
  limit: 3,
});
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

invoices = stripe.Invoice.list(limit=3)
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$invoices = $stripe->invoices->all(['limit' => 3]);
```

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = '<<secret key>>'

invoices = Stripe::Invoice.list({limit: 3})
```
