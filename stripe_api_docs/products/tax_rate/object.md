**nullable dictionary**  
Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.

### effective_percentage
**nullable float**

### flat_amount
**nullable dictionary**  
The amount of the tax rate when the `rate_type` is `flat_amount`. Tax rates with `rate_type` `percentage` can vary based on the transaction, resulting in this field being `null`. This field exposes the amount and currency of the flat tax rate.

#### flat_amount.amount
**integer**  
Amount of the tax when the `rate_type` is `flat_amount`. This positive integer represents how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).

#### flat_amount.currency
**string**  
Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase.
