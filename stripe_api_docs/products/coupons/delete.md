# Delete a coupon

You can delete coupons via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. However, deleting a coupon does not affect any customers who have already applied the coupon; it means that new customers can’t redeem the coupon. You can also delete coupons via the API.

An object with the deleted coupon’s ID and a deleted flag upon success. Otherwise, this call raises [an error](#errors), such as if the coupon has already been deleted.


```dotnet
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<secret key>>";

var service = new CouponService();
Coupon deleted = service.Delete("jMT0WJUD");
```

```go
stripe.Key = "<<secret key>>"

params := &stripe.CouponParams{};
result, err := coupon.Del("jMT0WJUD", params);
```

```java
Stripe.apiKey = "<<secret key>>";

Coupon resource = Coupon.retrieve("jMT0WJUD");

Coupon coupon = resource.delete();
```

```node
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<secret key>>');

const deleted = await stripe.coupons.del('jMT0WJUD');
```

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = "<<secret key>>"

deleted = stripe.Coupon.delete("jMT0WJUD")
```

```php
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<secret key>>');

$deleted = $stripe->coupons->delete('jMT0WJUD', []);
```

```ruby
