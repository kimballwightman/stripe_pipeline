  - `recurring.meter` (nullable string)
    The meter tracking the usage of a metered price

  - `recurring.usage_type` (enum)
    Configures how the quantity per period should be determined. Can be either `metered` or `licensed`. `licensed` automatically bills the `quantity` set when adding it to a subscription. `metered` aggregates the total usage based on usage records. Defaults to `licensed`.

- `tiers_mode` (nullable enum)
  Defines if the tiering price should be `graduated` or `volume` based. In `volume`-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per unit price. In `graduated` tiering, pricing can change as the quantity grows.

- `transform_quantity` (nullable object)
  Apply a transformation to the reported usage or set quantity before computing the amount billed. Cannot be combined with `tiers`.

  - `transform_quantity.divide_by` (integer)
    Divide usage by this number.

  - `transform_quantity.round` (enum)
    After division, either round the result `up` or `down`.

- `type` (enum)
  One of `one_time` or `recurring` depending on whether the price is for a one-time purchase or a recurring (subscription) purchase.
