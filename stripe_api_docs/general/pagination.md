# Pagination

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can [list charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/list.md), [list customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/list.md), and [list invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list.md). These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: `limit`, `starting_after`, and `ending_before`.

Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The `ending_before` parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the `starting_after` or `ending_before` parameter, but not both simultaneously.

Our client libraries offer [auto-pagination helpers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto.md) to traverse all pages of a list.
`limit` (optional, default is 10)
This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.
`starting_after` (optional object ID)
A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` to fetch the next page of the list.
`ending_before` (optional object ID)
A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` to fetch the previous page of the list.
`object` (string, value is "list")
A string that provides a description of the object type that returns.
`data` (array)
An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters.
`has_more` (boolean)
Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If `false`, this set comprises the end of the list.
`url` (url)
The URL for accessing this list.
