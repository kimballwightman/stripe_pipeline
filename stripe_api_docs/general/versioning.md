# Versioning

Each major release, such as [Acacia](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/acacia.md), includes changes that arenâ€™t [backward-compatible](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades.md#what-changes-does-stripe-consider-to-be-backward-compatible) with previous releases. Upgrading to a new major release can require updates to existing code. Each monthly release includes only backward-compatible changes, and uses the same name as the last major release. You can safely upgrade to a new monthly release without breaking any existing code. The current version is 2025-06-30.basil. For information on all API versions, view our [API changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog.md).

You can upgrade your API version in [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench). As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.
